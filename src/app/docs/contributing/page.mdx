# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how to get started.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sunya-landing-page.git
cd sunya-landing-page/package
./bin/install  # Installs sunya to ~/.local/bin
```

Or run sunya directly: `./bin/sunya scan` from a project with contracts.

Test with a Foundry project: `forge init my-token`, add `sunya.config.json` with `contractsDir: "./src"`, run `sunya scan`.

## Contribution steps

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/foo-bar`)
3. Edit `bin/sunya` or `bin/install` as needed
4. Test against a project with Solidity contracts
5. Commit and open a PR
