# Slither

Sunya uses [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) for static analysis of EVM smart contracts. Run `sunya install` to install Slither.

| Detector type | Examples |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Vulnerabilities | Reentrancy, unchecked external calls, unsafe low-level calls |
| Best practices | Naming conventions, unused state variables |
| Solidity | Version constraints, compiler warnings |

Slither integrates with Foundry—it compiles via `forge build` and runs 100+ detectors. Output includes file paths, line numbers, and references to detector documentation.
